# CHAPTER_4
# Creating a Starter Project Template

A basic Flutter application running successfully on an emulator. The main.dart file contains the app's main logic, where the MyApp widget is defined as a stateless widget. It uses a MaterialApp with a blue theme and sets HomeScreen as the initial screen. The output on the emulator displays the HomeScreen widget with a simple user interface, showing "Home" at the top and a bold, centered message that reads "Welcome Home." The console below indicates that the app has been launched successfully, although there is a warning about an obsolete Gradle version, suggesting that the compileSdkVersion in the Gradle configuration might need updating. Overall, the app appears to function as intended, demonstrating a working setup for a basic Flutter project.
